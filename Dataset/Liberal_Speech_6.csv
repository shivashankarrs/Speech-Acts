105,The threat is real so we need to be crystal-clear about what our votes will mean.,Assertive,Other,,
106,"When it comes to the minor parties, be they Lambie, Xenophon, Lazarus or Hanson - if you only really know the leader of a minor party, but you don’t really know their candidates, and you don’t really know their policies then don’t vote for them.",Assertive,Other,,
107,"If your local vote is for Labor, Greens or an Independent, and you are in one of the 20 or so key battleground seats across the country, ",Assertive,Labor,,1.0

117,We have weathered global shocks before and weathered them well.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
118,Despite the greatest terms of trade shock in our history with the fall in global commodity prices since the peak of the mining boom; in the year to March we are growing faster than any of the G7 economies and well above the OECD average.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,

124,"If on the other hand, we were to falter in our plan to transition the economy, there is a real risk of Australia falling off the back of the pack of the world’s leading economies.",Assertive,Liberal,,
125,"This is no time to pull the doona over our heads – or as Labor and the Greens would have it, to pretend that the good times will just keep rolling no matter how much you tax, how much you borrow, or how much you spend.",Assertive-V,Labor,,
126,That is just not how it works in the global economy of the 21st century.,Assertive,Labor,,
127,"To seize the opportunities, we have to be competitive and to that end ensure government is not imposing additional tax burdens on businesses and families that stifle the incentives to innovate, to invest, to grow, to create jobs.",Assertive,Liberal,,

136,"Today, I can announce an additional $48 million for scholarships under the Smith Family’s Learning for Life program.",Commissive-A,Liberal,Specific,

143,"Our Coalition plan offers practical policy solutions to strengthen the economy, strengthen our society, and leverage opportunities for a better future.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,

149,"our continuous shipbuilding strategy will ensure that Australia retains a sovereign capability to build and sustain naval vessels, securing thousands of advanced manufacturing jobs for decades to come.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
150,"Our border protection policy depends on three pillars - boat turn-backs, offshore processing and Temporary Protection Visas.",Commissive-A,Liberal,Specific,
151,Labor has already abandoned TPVs so they do not have the same policy as we do - they don’t even claim to have the same policy as we do. ,Assertive-S,Labor,,
152,And who would trust them on the rest.,Assertive,Labor,,
153,We must never forget how Labor in government failed Australia at the border.,Assertive,Labor,,
154,Labor’s abandonment of John Howard’s proven border protection policy ,Assertive-S,Labor,,1.0
155,opened the door to the people smugglers.,Assertive-V,Labor,,
156,"The result - 50,000 unauthorised arrivals on 800 boats, 1,200 deaths at sea of which we know, over 8,000 children put into detention, 17 detention centres opened and an $11 billion border protection budget blowout.",Assertive-V,Labor,,
157,"In contrast, the Coalition has restored security at the border, integrity to our immigration program - and with it the trust of the Australian public.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
158,I am proud to announce that today marks 700 days without a successful people-smuggling venture to our country.,Expressive,Liberal,,
159,I am also very proud to announce that we have removed every child from detention in Australia.,Expressive,Liberal,,
160,But the lesson of Labor in government is that success cannot be taken for granted and can be all too easily undone.,Assertive,Labor,,
161,"The fact is 50 Labor candidates, members and senators do not support Mr Shorten’s stated policy on boats. ",Assertive-S,Labor,,
162,"Whatever he may say today, any policy commitment would be under siege the moment Labor came to office.",Assertive-V,Labor,,
163,"In tandem with the Greens, Labor would overturn the very policies that have kept our borders secure.",Assertive-V,Labor,,
164,We know this because hope rarely triumphs over experience.,Assertive,Labor,,
165,They have failed Australia before.,Assertive,Labor,,
166,The people smugglers are looking for the earliest sign that an Australian Government will waver.,Assertive,Liberal,,
167,We must not. ,Assertive,Liberal,,
168,I will not.,Commissive-A,Liberal,Specific,
169,"The Coalition is resolute in defending the sovereignty, the security of our borders.",Commissive-O,Liberal,,
170,Our policies are tough. ,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
171,There is no doubt about that.,Assertive,Liberal,,
172,But these policies have stopped the drownings at sea. ,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
173,They have restored the integrity of and trust in our large but orderly immigration and refugee programs.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
174,Public trust in the Government to determine who can come to Australia and how long they can stay is an essential foundation of our success as a multicultural society.,Assertive,Liberal,,
175,"It begins as Craig said with respect for the world's oldest continuous culture, that of our First Australians and extends to a celebration of our rich diversity as a nation built by immigration.",Assertive,Liberal,,
176,Strong border protection policies instil confidence.,Assertive,Liberal,,
177,A weak and failing system has the opposite effect.,Assertive,Liberal,,
178,"That is the risk in a Labor-Greens-independent alliance - they lack the conviction, they lack the will to keep our borders secure.",Assertive-V,Labor,,
179,"To protect our economic security and to protect our borders, we need a stable Coalition majority Government - not a Parliament in chaos.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
180,To further strengthen our domestic security I announce initiatives that go to that most fundamental of liberties – the right to live without fear of violence.,Assertive,Liberal,,
181,My first announcement as Prime Minister was a new $100 million package to encourage all Australians squarely to confront the ugly truth of violence against women and children in our society.,Assertive-S,Liberal,,
182,"Today I can announce a $64 million commitment to crack down on the trafficking of illegal firearms on our streets, in particular by criminal gangs.",Commissive-A,Liberal,Specific,
183,This will extend the work of our National Anti-Gang Squad in tracking and detecting the illegal guns trade in our cities and regions and locking up those who seek to profit from it.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
184,And it will build up the forensic and intelligence assets of the Australian Federal Police to better detect incoming shipments of illegal firearms and to go after the criminal syndicates who sell them.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
185,The Government I lead will live within our means.,Commissive-A,Liberal,Vague,
186,This is not only the prudent thing to do - it is the right thing to do. ,Assertive,Liberal,,
187,There is nothing fair about piling a mountain of debt on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
188,And it serves as a crucial buffer against external risks and shocks.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
189,My Coalition team is determined to show the economic leadership to ensure young Australians do not start from behind.,Assertive,Liberal,,
190,That is why I counsel all Australians against a roll of the dice on independents or minor parties.,Assertive,Other,,
191,A vote for anyone other than the Liberal and National Party candidates and there is a risk Australians will next week find themselves with Bill Shorten as Prime Minister - and no certainty at all about their future.,Assertive-V,Labor,,
192,That is why I am urging every Australian to think of this election as if their single vote will determine what sort of government we have after July the 2nd.,Directive,Other,,
193,"We can have the sort of chaotic government we see in Queensland today, with a minority Labor government trapped in policy paralysis.",Assertive-V,Labor,,
194,"Or there is the alternative model of a stable, confident administration under Premier Mike Baird here in New South Wales. ",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
195,Under Premier Baird a strong economy and strong budget position is funding new roads and rail and better health and education services.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
196,"At this election for our nation’s leadership, I am asking Australians to make a clear choice - back a strong and stable Coalition majority Government that can press ahead with our plan for a stronger new economy.",Directive,Other,,
197,"Our plan will deliver the economic security that enables Australians to fulfil their aspirations as individuals, as families, as communities.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
198,That is why I am asking my fellow Australians at this election to support our Coalition’s National Economic Plan for a Strong New Economy.,Directive,Liberal,,
199,"This national economic plan will secure Australia’s position for decades to come as a high-wage, first world economy of the 21st Century, with a generous social welfare safety net.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
200,"That means a thriving business sector, where there is the confidence to create more jobs, where small family enterprises are encouraged to think big – to invest, to innovate, to grow their business and employ other Australians.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
201,"This means an Australia competing with the world’s best in the hi-tech industries and all the other jobs of the future and a strong sustainable advanced manufacturing sector, sharing in the heavy lifting in our new economy.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
202,"Our farmers and service industries flourishing like never before, with millions of new customers in the markets of Asia to our north, where half of the world’s middle class will soon reside.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
203,"And only disciplined financial management can guarantee the long-term funding we need to support the hospitals and schools, the roads, the infrastructure - all the services Australians want and expect from government.",Assertive-V,Liberal,,
204,My fellow Australians we alone have the economic plan our nation needs in these times of opportunity and challenge.,Assertive-V,Liberal,,
205,We have always been a lucky country - but today more than ever we need to make our own luck.,Assertive,Liberal,,
206,Get this right and together Australians will succeed as never before.,Assertive,Liberal,,

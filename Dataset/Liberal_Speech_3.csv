130,Its obvious isn’t it? ,Interrogative,131,Other,,
131,And yet everything Labor and the Greens are doing will discourage business and discourage investment. ,Assertive-V,132,Labor,,

149,And its worth reflecting what we’re doing there. ,Assertive,150,Liberal,,
150,We’re providing tax offsets and we’re providing relief from capital gains tax.,Assertive,151,Liberal,,
151,Why are we doing that? ,Interrogative,152,Liberal,,
152,Why does everyone agree that is a good approach? ,Interrogative,153#154,Liberal,,
153,"Because we know that if you want more of something, you reduce the tax on it. ",Assertive,155,Liberal,,
154,"If you want less of something, you increase the tax on it. ",Assertive,155,Liberal,,
155,So what we’re doing is we’re reducing tax in order to promote more investment. ,Assertive,156,Liberal,,
156,And that will deliver more investment.,Assertive-V,157,Liberal,,
157,"What Labor is doing, they are increasing taxes on investment and that can have only one consequence, of less investment and less jobs, less opportunities for Australians.",Assertive-V,,Labor,,
158,"Now to succeed in the 21st century, we need to ensure that Australia and Australians are more innovative, more technologically sophisticated. ",Assertive,159,Other,,

218,"There are risks in the things that we can't control, like the price of iron ore, or growth projections in China, or the stability of the Eurozone.",Assertive,219,Labor,,
219,"But what I know for sure, is that we are best able to deal with these challenges, if we have a strong and resilient economy, if we have a Government with strong economic leadership which understands what drives business.",Assertive,220,Liberal,,
220,A government with an economic plan that will encourage investment and employment. ,Assertive,221#222,Liberal,,
221,That's the Government I lead. ,Assertive-V,,Liberal,,
222,That's the clear plan we have laid out. ,Assertive-V,223,Liberal,,
223,"That's the plan that will deliver us the jobs and growth in the years ahead: a strong economy, a resilient economy, backing the enterprise and commitment of Australians.",Assertive-V,,Liberal,,
224,"Only a sustainable budget, built on strong economic growth, can deliver Australians the services they want and expect, like guaranteed funding for health, education and infrastructure.",Assertive,225,Liberal,,
225,"Neither Labor nor their friends the Greens or Independents, have a credible plan to deal with the economic challenges of this the 21st century. ",Assertive-V,,Labor,,
226,Our Labor opponents have nothing to say about generating investment and enterprise. ,Assertive-V,225,Labor,,
227,"They have nothing to say about securing prosperity today, or forging the growth of the industries and jobs of the future.",Assertive-V,225,Labor,,
228,Labor’s only plan is to impose $100 billion in additional taxes over the next 10 years.,Assertive-V,225#229#230,Labor,,
229,They are proposing taxes which will actively slow economic growth. ,Assertive-V,231,Labor,,
230,"Labor’s policies would kill incentive, damage jobs and stop the successful transition of the our economy dead in its tracks.",Assertive-V,231,Labor,,
231,Let's be quite clear about this. ,Assertive,232,Liberal,,
232,You want more investment; you lower the tax on investment.,Assertive,233#234#235,Liberal,,
233,"As I said a moment ago, that is why we recently all voted to provide capital gains tax relief and offsets to encourage people to invest in start-up companies.",Assertive-S,,Liberal,,
234,That’s why we provide tax incentives for research and development. ,Assertive,,Liberal,,
235,"It’s obvious, that’s why taxes have been increased and imposed over many years on tobacco- to discourage people from smoking.",Assertive,236,Liberal,,
236,If you want less of something you increase the tax on it. ,Assertive,237,Liberal,,
237,Labor plainly wants less investment.,Assertive-V,238,Labor,,
238,"And that means less growth, less jobs.",Assertive-V,247,Labor,,
239,They’re planning to ban negative gearing - the ability of working Australians to invest and offset losses against their personal wage or salary income.,Assertive,241,Labor,,
240,"They're banning negative gearing on every single asset class - shares, business, property, commercial property, residential property - except for new dwellings.",Assertive,241,Labor,,
241,So what’s that going to do?,Interrogative,242#243,Labor,,
242,That also restricts and reduces investment.,Assertive-V,,Labor,,
243,"You reduce investment, you reduce growth and jobs.",Assertive-V,247,Labor,,
244,What about capital gains tax? ,Interrogative,245,Labor,,
245,That is a classic tax on investment and they are going to increase it by 50 per cent. ,Assertive-V,246,Labor,,
246,"Has only one result- again, less investment.",Assertive-V,247,Labor,,
247,"Now this is what awaits Australians, should we return to the chaos of a Labor-Greens alliance. ",Interrogative,248#249#251,Labor,,
248,"Less investment, less jobs, less confidence, less economic growth and more uncertainty. ",Assertive-V,,Labor,,
249,"A less secure future for all of us, but especially for those for whom we should be acting with the greatest fiduciary trust- the greatest and deepest responsibility.",Assertive-V,,Labor,,
250,Our children and our grandchildren. ,Assertive,251#252,Labor,,
251,"Labor renders their future insecure, and uncertain.",Assertive-V,,Labor,,
252,"We are ensuring with every element of our plan, that their future is secured. ",Assertive-V,14#253,Liberal,,
253,"That there will be greater opportunities for them to start a business, to find a new job, to find a better job. ",Assertive-V,254,Liberal,,
254,For them to seize the opportunities of the hour. ,Assertive-V,,Liberal,,
255,We are creating that environment with an economic plan- every element of which will deliver stronger economic growth and jobs. ,Assertive-V,252#256,Liberal,,
256,And our opponents seem determined to go in precisely the opposite direction.,Assertive-V,257,Labor,,
257,This is a very clear choice. ,Assertive,258,Other,,
258,"And so as pre-poll voting opens in the next few days, I urge all Australians to think very carefully, about the choice they are to make.",Directive,259,Other,,
259,Just a few thousand votes across a handful of seats will decide if the Greens and Independents will be once again calling the shots in a Shorten-Greens minority government.,Assertive,260,Labor,,
260,A vote for any candidate other than a Coalition candidate is a vote for this chaos.,Assertive,261,Liberal,,
261,"We have seen the effect of this dysfunction in the Senate, with vital economic reforms being blocked by Labor, Greens and the independents.",Assertive,262,Labor,,
262,That is why I called this double dissolution election.,Assertive,275,Labor,,
263,"Restoring the rule of law in our construction industry through the restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, is an essential reform if Australians are to have the infrastructure they need at a price they can afford – from hospitals and schools, to office towers or apartment blocks.",Assertive,264,Liberal,,
264,"Labor, the Greens and cross-benchers blocked this reform twice in the Senate,",Assertive-S,266,Labor,,1.0
265,despite evidence to the Heydon Royal Commission showing widespread malfeasance by union officials on construction sites across the country.,Assertive-V,264,Labor,,
266,"At the latest count, there are more than 100 officials of the CFMEU before courts and tribunals on more than a thousand charges over breaches of industrial law.",Assertive-V,275,Labor,,
267,Bill Shorten in Government set up the RSRT with the express objective of putting owner drivers out of business to benefit large trucking companies whose employees were members of the TWU.,Assertive-V,268,Labor,,
268,"And it worked. 50,000 owner drivers were off the road, they were out of business, their families had no income.",Assertive-V,269,Labor,,
269,"Thankfully we were, just, able to abolish that Tribunal and keep those families in business. ",Assertive-S,270,Liberal,,
270,"But make no mistake if Labor wins this election, as it did before, the RSRT will be back - the Transport Workers Union will demand and will get its reward and family businesses once again will be the losers.",Assertive-V,275,Labor,,
271,"And, now, in Victoria, unfolding we see an outrageous attempt by the Andrews Labor Government and the United Firefighters Union to impose an effective takeover by the union of the Country Fire Authority volunteers.",Assertive-S,275,Labor,,
272,"Like the SES, like the Surf Lifesavers Associations, the CFA volunteers are vital to the fabric of our community.",Assertive,274,Liberal,,
273,We have been reminded of the selfless service of our volunteers this very week.,Assertive,274,Liberal,,
274,"And that is why we are committed to standing shoulder to shoulder with the volunteers and amending the Fair Work Act to protect volunteer organisations, like the CFA, from union takeovers.",Commissive-A,275,Liberal,Specific,
275,"That is why it is so important Australians consider their vote very carefully at this election, for both the Senate and the House of Representatives.",Assertive,276,Other,,
276,"Every single vote for the Nick Xenophon Team, the Independents or Labor or the Greens brings us closer to Bill Shorten and The Greens running Australia.",Assertive,277,Labor,,
277,"That would mean Labor’s tax hikes on investment, the Greens tax hikes on superannuation, and Nick Xenophon’s tax hikes on traded goods.",Assertive-V,278,Labor,,
278,"So now is not the time for a protest vote or a wasted vote; it is the time to use your vote in support of a strong economic plan – and to prevent a hung parliament that would bring government and our economic transition to a grinding halt, costing jobs and imperilling our future.",Assertive,279#280,Other,,
279,"If you want a better future for yourself and your family, don’t risk yet another change of government, yet another Labor Prime Minister and the chaos of yet another minority government.",Assertive-V,,Labor,,
280,"The only way to ensure that there is continued, strong, stable government with a clear national economic plan is to vote for the Coalition in both houses.",Assertive-V,281,Liberal,,
281,"With your vote we can complete the job we’ve started, stick to our economic plan for jobs and growth – and together we can make Australia stronger and our future more secure.",Assertive,282,Liberal,,

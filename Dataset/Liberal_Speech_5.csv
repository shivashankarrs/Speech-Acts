69,That explains the shambles around their budget costings.,Assertive-V,70#75,Labor,,
70,"Over this campaign, it has been a sorry tale of Labor budget backflips and policy reversals.",Assertive-S,,Labor,,
71,"The first was on foreign aid, where they previously had said our policy approach was one they “certainly couldn’t continue with”.",Assertive-S,70,Labor,,
72,"Then they backflipped on the $4.5 billion Schoolkids Bonus, which they had previously said was“a demonstration of Labor's commitment to education.”",Assertive-S,70,Labor,,
73,And then there’s the changes to the pension asset test - another backflip.,Assertive-S,70#74,Labor,,
74,"They were the same changes that Bill Shorten only opposed very recently in his book, saying that “when Labor formulates retirement policy...we look beyond the headlines and cheap politics.”",Assertive-S,,Labor,,

81,"Their budget bottom line over the medium term relies on over $100 billion in additional taxes, with tax revenue approaching 26 per cent of GDP – this would take Labor to the highest tax-to-GDP ratio in this country since at least 1970.",Assertive-V,82,Labor,,
82,Labor’s fiscal strategy is predicated on no further tax relief for a decade or more.,Assertive-V,83,Labor,,
83,"By 2027, under that scenario, an additional 750,000 Australians will be paying the top marginal tax rate of 49 per cent - a $19 billion tax grab guaranteed to stifle the incentives to work.",Assertive-V,84,Labor,,
84,"Hard-working Australians will be appalled and the closer you look, the more destructive it becomes.",Assertive-V,85,Labor,,
85,A negative gearing and capital gains tax policy which aims to hit Australians with $37 billion of tax increases - one of the largest tax increases in recent history.,Assertive-V,86,Labor,,

91,How is this acceptable?,Interrogative,96#111,Labor,,

93,They have failed to fund over 96 per cent of the so-called hospital cuts they solemnly swore they would restore and were advertising on television about last night.,Assertive-V,94,Labor,,
94,What a Labor hoax.,Assertive-V,96#111,Labor,,

104,"In the Budget we announced as you know, the most comprehensive changes to the taxation of superannuation in a decade.",Assertive-S,99#105,Liberal,,
105,"Now not all of these policies have been popular, but they make the system fairer and more flexible.",Assertive-V,106,Liberal,,
106,We had the courage to put them in the Budget and take them to an election.,Assertive,,Liberal,,
107,We will not be making any further changes to superannuation in the next term of Government if we are re-elected.,Commissive-A,99#108#109,Liberal,Specific,
108,Mr Shorten cannot match that claim.,Assertive-V,110,Labor,,
109,Our superannuation goes to the heart of economic security.,Assertive,110,Liberal,,
110,"Mr Shorten and Labor are now a policy vacuum on this vital issue, playing political games with the retirement plans of millions of Australians.",Assertive-V,111,Labor,,
111,Like his Budget black hole this demonstrates no economic leadership at all.,Assertive-V,112,Labor,,
112,Labor’s recklessness is utterly ill-suited to the demands of our times.,Assertive,113,Labor,,
113,They are in denial about the state of the Budget and the risks in the global economy.,Assertive,115,Labor,,

116,His priority at the election is purely political.,Assertive,117,Labor,,
117,"As he says himself, he wants to run Australia like a trade union.",Assertive,118#119,Labor,,
118,How else to explain his incredibly ideological war against business.,Assertive,,Labor,,
119,How else to explain his dishonest campaign to frighten frail and elderly people into thinking their health services are at risk.,Assertive,120,Labor,,
120,Medicare is guaranteed under the Coalition and Bill Shorten knows it.,Assertive-V,121,Liberal,,
121,He has been mocked in this very room for spreading these falsehoods.,Assertive,122,Labor,,
122,"He diminishes only himself, but he persists with these lies in the hope that he can deceive enough Australians to think that government services never at risk are under threat.",Assertive,123,Labor,,
123,Australians are well and truly over this tactic of setting out deliberately and dishonestly to fuel fear and division.,Assertive,124,Labor,,
124,"The only long-term threat to our universal health care system is the risk of governments adopting tax and spend policies that stifle economic growth, damage business confidence, discourage investment and employment.",Assertive-V,125,Labor,,
125,"Only a stronger economy can deliver the growth in revenues we need to pay, in the longer term, for the services that we want.",Assertive,126#127#128#129#130,Liberal,,
126,And only the Coalition has the plan to drive that growth.,Assertive-V,,Liberal,,

128,"Only the Coalition’s spending commitments are fully funded, with a sustainable path to surplus.",Assertive-V,,Liberal,,
129,Only the Coalition will protect our borders and keep Australians safe.,Assertive-V,,Liberal,,
130,"And only the Coalition can form strong, stable majority Government.",Assertive-V,131,Liberal,,
131,It is worth remembering that Australia has not had a strong majority Government returned to office at an election going back to 2007.,Assertive,132,Other,,
132,And that is why this election is a critical choice for Australians.,Assertive,133,Other,,
133,"Leave it to independents and preferences to decide and Australians will find themselves, this time next week, with no clarity about their future.",Assertive,134,Other,,
134,"It is a roll of the dice that could well result in Bill Shorten as Prime Minister, with unions, Greens and independents pulling the strings.",Assertive,135,Labor,,
135,This threat is real.,Assertive,136,Labor,,
136,"So when it comes to the minor parties - be they Lambie, Xenophon, Lazarus or Hanson - Australians need to consider very carefully the impact on practical policy outcomes and the workability of the Parliament.",Assertive,137,Other,,
137,"I say to Australians again; if you don’t know the leader of a minor party, or if that is all you know - the identity of the minor party’s leader, but you don’t know their candidates - and you don’t really know their policies, then don’t vote for them.",Assertive,138,Other,,
138,Australians won’t want to end up next week with a result they didn’t see coming.,Assertive,139,Other,,
139,"So I say again, a vote for Labor, Greens or an independent in one of the 20 key battleground seats across the country, is, in effect, a vote for the chaos of a hung parliament; a budget black hole; big Labor taxes; less jobs; more boats.",Assertive-V,140,Labor,,
140,"We can have the sort of chaotic government we see in today’s Queensland, with a minority Labor Government trapped in policy paralysis.",Assertive-V,141,Labor,,
141,"Or there is the alternative model of a stable, confident administration under Premier Mike Baird in NSW, where a strong economy and strong Budget position is funding new roads and rail and better health and education.",Assertive-V,142,Liberal,,
142,So that is why I am urging Australians to vote for their local Liberal or National candidate in the House and in the Senate ,Directive,143#150,Liberal,,1.0
143,and to return a stable Coalition majority Government so we can stick to the plan that is delivering jobs and growth and securing our economic future.,Assertive-V,,Liberal,,
144,"Now obviously, there is not the time here to name them all, but can I mention just two local candidates who exemplify the dedication and the energy we ask of our elected representatives.",Assertive,145,Liberal,,
145,"Ned Mannoun, in the southwest Sydney seat of Werriwa and Julia Banks, our candidate for the seat of Chisholm, in Melbourne’s east, have both campaigned so well.",Assertive,146#147#148#149,Liberal,,
146,They are in with a chance of claiming two long-held Labor electorates.,Assertive-V,,Liberal,,

148,Both come with direct practical experience in business.,Assertive,151,Liberal,,

151,"I give a special shout out to Ned Mannoun in Werriwa and Julia Banks in Chisholm, two outstanding candidates.",Assertive,,Liberal,,

154,Every element of our Coalition economic plan is directed at delivering the stronger economy so vital for Australians to achieve these aspirations.,Assertive-V,155,Liberal,,
155,"Together, Australians have the talents and the capacity to make the successful transition to a stronger new economy.",Assertive,156,Liberal,,
156,"Together, as a nation, we have the resourcefulness, the resilience to get the job done.",Assertive,157,Liberal,,
157,"And I believe Australians, overwhelmingly, would think it is not before time that our Parliament began to work with a greater unity of purpose towards that goal.",Assertive,158,Liberal,,
158,"So get the next three years right, stick together, stick to our economic plan and we can all look forward with confidence and optimism to an Australia where our very best years are still ahead of us.",Assertive-V,,Liberal,,
